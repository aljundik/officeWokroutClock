What is it?
Our application should encourage people who work at office to take short breaks from their work and use them to exercise. Both actions were proved to have significant positive effect on people's health.

Motivation
Though the positive effect of taking short breaks when working in office is undeniable, it is difficult to remember to actually take these breaks. And it is even more challenging to use the breaks to exercise. Our goal is to remind people when it is time to take a break and to motivate them to improve their health with very simple, yet effective, exercise. The set of exercises is designed specifically for people working in office. It aims at the most common office-related health issues and most of the exercises are discrete enough to practice at your desk.

The application was designed to be easy to use. In the picture below is the welcome page. 
The Guid Book is a user guide for the application. Track page allows the user to see daily statistics of distance he/she walks at work.
In the settings, the user sets his/her working hours and whether he/she wants to be reminded with an alarm. Even though it is recommended to pause every hour, we understand that this might feel unconvinient for some people. Therefore, we included an option to choose the frequency of pauses. After setting this, the user is reminded by notifications in the interval he/she has set. 
The user is then prompted to do the set of exercises. Each exercise has a timer to show the progress. 
To make the user more enthusiastic about the exercise, we included a simple character - Meatball. The user collects points for each exercise and the more points he/she has, the happier Meatball is. On the other hand, when the user skips the exercises, he/she loses points and risks that his/her Meatball will become unhappy. The stages are shown below.

Technology
We have divided our technology part into two parts front-end and back-end development.
Front-end Development:
For front-end, Ionic framework is using along with HTML and CSS. As HTML and CSS are essential part for web and mobile application. For slicing images or editing images, Adobe-Photoshop has been used.

Back-end Development:
For back-end, we have used Angularjs along with Backand service. AngularJs is very power JavaScript library mostly used for Back-end development during hybrid mobile application. It suits all the platform.
